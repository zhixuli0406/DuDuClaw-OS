#
# cage(1) SYNOPSIS (verified against the upstream man page source,
# cage-kiosk/cage, cage.1.scd): "cage [options...] [--] [application...]"
# — everything after -- is the child process's own argv, launched with
# WAYLAND_DISPLAY (and friends) already exported by cage itself, standard
# behavior for any Wayland compositor spawning its one client. `-d`
# ("Don't draw client side decorations when possible") is belt-and-braces
# alongside Chromium's own --kiosk (which already requests a borderless
# window on its own) — not load-bearing by itself.
#
# Every Chromium flag below has its exact string confirmed against
# chromium/chromium source this round (chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc,
# base/base_switches.h, ui/ozone/public/ozone_switches.cc) — not guessed
# or copied from a third-party "chromium flags" list:
#   --kiosk                     kKioskMode: "Enable kiosk mode."
#   --ozone-platform=wayland    kOzonePlatform: run Chromium's native
#                                Wayland backend under cage, instead of
#                                falling back through XWayland (which
#                                cage's own xwayland dependency would also
#                                support) — one fewer moving part for the
#                                only app this compositor ever runs.
#   --no-first-run              kNoFirstRun: skip first-run UI/promo
#                                surfaces.
#   --noerrdialogs               kNoErrorDialogs (base/base_switches.h):
#                                "Suppresses all error dialogs when
#                                present."
#   --hide-crash-restore-bubble  kHideCrashRestoreBubble: suppresses the
#                                "restore pages?" bubble after an unclean
#                                shutdown — expected after every power cut
#                                on an appliance, not a noteworthy event.
#   --disable-component-update  kDisableComponentUpdate: this is Debian's
#                                chromium package (no Google Update
#                                machinery to begin with), but the
#                                component-updater subsystem still exists
#                                independently of that and would otherwise
#                                phone home on a schedule.
#   --user-data-dir=...         kUserDataDir: explicit profile path on the
#                                only writable partition, rather than
#                                relying on implicit XDG resolution off
#                                $HOME (which is /data/duduclaw-kiosk, set
#                                via the user's passwd entry — see
#                                postinst.d/20-users-and-units.sh).
#
# Translate-bar suppression is deliberately NOT a command-line flag here:
# there is no verified single switch that fully disables it (components/
# translate/core/common/translate_switches.cc only has URL/security-origin
# overrides, no on/off toggle). It's set via Chromium's documented
# enterprise policy mechanism instead — see
# /etc/chromium/policies/managed/duduclaw-kiosk.json in this same image
# (a plain JSON file with no room for its own comment; the policy-path and
# policy-name verification for it lives in README.md and this comment
# block instead): policy::kPolicyPath resolves to "/etc/chromium/policies"
# for non-Google-Chrome branding (components/policy/core/common/
# policy_paths.cc — Debian's chromium package uses this branding, not
# GOOGLE_CHROME_BRANDING), "managed" is the mandatory-policy subdirectory
# (kMandatoryConfigDir, config_dir_policy_loader.cc), and "TranslateEnabled"
# is policy::key::kTranslateEnabled — Chromium's own source even documents
# the exact JSON shape in a network-traffic-annotation comment
# (translate_url_fetcher.cc: `chrome_policy { TranslateEnabled {
# TranslateEnabled: false } }`).
#
# The URL is a build-time constant, not read from config.toml at runtime —
# same "no live templating" precedent as nftables.conf's DASHBOARD_PORT.
# 18789 is the gateway's documented default port
# (crates/duduclaw-core/src/config.rs); if that default ever changes, this
# file, nftables.conf, and duduclaw-firstboot-provision.sh's written
# config.toml all need the same update together.

# ever reach a file chooser / notification / settings portal (that research
# note's §5.3 lists this as an unverified debt — this is the fix).
#
# dbus-run-session starts a private session bus, exports
# DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, execs the command, and tears the bus down on
# exit. The whole session (compositor + shell + anything they spawn) has to
# share ONE bus, so the wrapper goes around this entire script via re-exec
# rather than around any individual branch below. Fail-open: if the binary
# isn't installed the session still starts exactly as before, just without

# ── Audio: PipeWire + WirePlumber (D5, 2026-08-24) ───────────────────────
# Debian ships both as `systemd --user` units (pipewire.service /
# wireplumber.service under /usr/lib/systemd/user). This kiosk is a plain
# systemd SYSTEM service with User=duduclaw-kiosk and no logind session, so
# there is NO user manager to activate them — exactly the same reason the
# D-Bus session bus above has to be started by hand. So they are started
# here, as ordinary background children of this script, which also means
# systemd's default KillMode=control-group tears them down with the session.
#
# Started for EVERY session shape (comp / cage / chromium), before any
# compositor, because none of them depends on audio and audio depends on
# none of them: PipeWire only needs $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (already created at
# 0700 by the unit's RuntimeDirectory=) and, for WirePlumber, the session
# bus (started by the dbus-run-session re-exec at the top of this file).
#
# Fail-open on every branch, same contract as the fcitx5 block below: a box
# with no audio hardware, or an image built without these packages, must
# still reach a working screen. The shell reports the resulting state
# honestly rather than pretending — `crates/duduclaw-shell/src/audio/` fails
# to an explicit "audio unavailable" backend on Linux (NOT to its demo
# backend), and 系統設定 › 聲音 runs its own probe, so a missing daemon
# surfaces as 「音訊服務未啟動」 instead of a slider that moves and changes
# nothing.
#
# WirePlumber is started AFTER PipeWire's client socket exists rather than
# in parallel: it is a PipeWire client, and starting it against a socket
# that is not there yet just makes it retry-or-exit for no reason. The wait
# is bounded and non-fatal — past the budget we start it anyway and let it
# report its own failure to the journal, because a stuck wait here would
# delay the whole screen coming up.

    # press-and-release with no other key in between, "switch between FIRST
    # and current Input Method" — and a bare Shift press-and-release is also
    # the FIRST HALF of every `Shift+letter` chord an operator types for a
    # capital letter. Two operator reports converged on the same root cause
    # on a real OOBE run: "打不出小寫英文" (a field lands in `chewing`, per
    # `ActiveByDefault` below, before the operator has typed anything, so
    # every plain letter is captured into zhuyin composition instead of
    # committing — D3-f's own fix only covers a field the operator has
    # ALREADY tapped Shift in once) and "密碼欄打英文打一打突然變中文" (mid
    # -password, a Shift held for one capital letter gets misread as the
    # solitary alt-trigger tap and flips the whole field back to `chewing`
    # — VM-reproduced: `AltTriggerKeys=Shift_L` toggled the active IM on a
    # bare Shift with ZERO other key involved, `AltTriggerKeys=` empty left
    # it on `chewing` across two repeated bare-Shift taps, both confirmed
    # live via `fcitx5-remote -n` against a real fcitx5 process, not
    # inferred from the profile alone). `crates/duduclaw-shell`'s
    # `oobe/ime_focus.rs` (same round) closes the first report by proactively
    # switching an ASCII-only field's IM to `keyboard-us` on focus via
    # `fcitx5-remote -s`; this config change closes the second by removing
    # the only single-key gesture that could ever misfire mid-password. Any
    # field this appliance does NOT proactively switch (the Launcher search
    # box, chat) is unaffected by removing `AltTriggerKeys` — those fields
    # were never relying on a bare-Shift toggle to begin with; they already
    # start in `chewing` via `ActiveByDefault` and stay there.
    #
    # Ctrl+Space (`TriggerKeys`, fcitx5's own default, left unmodified) is

# ── Kiosk app selection ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Shell-S2 wave (2026-08-20) introduced the gpui shell under cage; the A4
# wave (2026-08-22) adds duduclaw-comp — DuDuClaw OS's own compositor —
# as the preferred session compositor, with cage kept as the automatic
# fallback rather than deleted (design doc DESIGN-native-gui-gpui-2026-08.md
# §13.5, D11: smithay self-built compositor). Three session shapes exist:
#
#   comp      duduclaw-comp owns the hardware (DRM/KMS via seatd) and
#             duduclaw-shell is its only client.  <- preferred
#   cage      cage owns the hardware and duduclaw-shell is its only client
#             (the Shell-S2 shape, still fully supported).
#   chromium  cage owns the hardware and Chromium kiosks the dashboard
#             (the pre-shell shape, byte-identical to before).
#
# Selection order, first match wins:
#   1. /etc/duduclaw/kiosk-app, matched as a whole word:
#        "chromium" -> chromium   (checked first: it was the ONLY token this
#                                  file ever recognized before this wave, so
#                                  its precedence must not change)
#        "comp"     -> comp
#        "cage" or "shell" -> cage ("shell" is the back-compat spelling: an
#                                  operator who wrote it before this wave
#                                  meant shell-under-cage, and must keep
#                                  getting exactly that)
#   2. Auto: comp+shell present and not failure-blacklisted -> comp;
#      else shell present -> cage; else chromium.

start_audio_session

# ── comp session ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Returns 1 when the session failed EARLY (caller falls back to cage);
# never returns on the healthy path — it `exit`s with the shell's own
# status so systemd's Restart=on-failure sees the real outcome.
#
# Env notes, all previously found the hard way:
#   - NO LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE here. That env on the process that OWNS the
#     hardware makes Mesa refuse ("Not allowed to force software rendering
#     when API explicitly selects a hardware device") — it made cage
#     segfault when it was set on cage instead of on cage's child
#     (crates/duduclaw-comp/BUILD.md "Launch details worth keeping"). In
#     this branch duduclaw-comp IS that process, so the same rule now
#     points at comp. Set it from /etc/duduclaw/kiosk.env only if you are
#     deliberately debugging a software-rendering path.
#   - $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR must already exist at mode 0700 before a compositor
#     starts (cage segfaults, not errors, without it — observed twice).
#     duduclaw-kiosk.service's RuntimeDirectory=/RuntimeDirectoryMode=0700
#     guarantees that; this script never creates it.
#   - WAYLAND_DISPLAY is explicitly UNSET for comp (`env -u`) so it takes
#     its "own the hardware" path rather than nesting itself as a client of
#     something else; DUDUCLAW_COMP_BACKEND is passed explicitly on top of
#     that, so the target backend is never implicit (same philosophy as
#     build.sh always passing --architecture even when it matches the
#     file default). A comp build that doesn't read that variable simply
#     ignores it — the unset WAYLAND_DISPLAY still selects the same path.

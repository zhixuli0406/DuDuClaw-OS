# DuDuClaw OS — appliance image

A bootable Debian-based disk image that turns a small x86-64 PC into a
headless DuDuClaw appliance: plug in power and ethernet, and the dashboard
comes up on the LAN at `http://duduclaw.local`. Everything after that
(model accounts, channel bots, first agent) is configured in the browser —
the box itself has no screen, keyboard, or interactive setup.

If a display *is* plugged into the box (HDMI/DP), it self-detects at boot
and shows the dashboard full-screen instead of sitting idle — see "Kiosk
display session" below. This is additive only: a box with nothing plugged
into its video output boots exactly as described above, unchanged.

This directory is the mkosi build recipe plus the supporting scripts. It
does **not** contain a pre-built image — you build one from source, on
your own machine, and can audit every line that goes into it (there is no
"trust us" step: the image is the recipe, run).

Every `mkosi.*` directory/file name is a recognized mkosi convention, not
an arbitrary choice — see the comments inside each file for what's been
independently checked against the upstream
[mkosi manual](https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/blob/main/mkosi/resources/man/mkosi.1.md)
and [systemd manuals](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/)
versus what's a documented-but-not-live-tested assumption.

## What gets built

One GPT disk image (`mkosi.output/duduclaw-os.raw`):

| Partition | GPT label | Contents | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ESP | `esp` | systemd-boot + Unified Kernel Images | shared by both root slots; mounted at **`/boot`** at runtime (not `/efi` — ask `bootctl -p`), so the factory UKI is `/boot/EFI/Linux/duduclaw-os_<version>.efi` |
| root A | `duduclaw-os_<version>` | the actual OS (Debian 13 + duduclaw + Node/Python/Docker/…) | populated at build time; the UKI's `root=PARTUUID=` points here |
| root B | `_empty` | empty, same size as A | `_empty` is `systemd-sysupdate`'s reserved "free slot" marker; the first update writes here and relabels it with its version |
| /data | `duduclaw-data` | empty ext4, grows to fill the disk | `~/.duduclaw`, Docker storage, model files — survives every A/B switch and rollback |

The two root labels are not decoration: `systemd-sysupdate` uses the GPT
partition label as its version ledger, matching installed instances against
`duduclaw-os_@v` and looking for `_empty` to find somewhere to write. Slot A's
label therefore tracks `mkosi.version`, and `build.sh` fails the build if the
two ever drift (`tools/uki-slots.py`).

The **same image** is both the installer and the shipped product: dd it to
a USB stick and boot a machine with an internal NVMe from it, and the
image writes a copy of itself onto that NVMe and powers off (see
`mkosi.extra/usr/local/sbin/duduclaw-usb-install.sh`). There is no
separate "installer" build.

## Prerequisites

- **Linux**: `mkosi` (Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install mkosi`), Docker (to
  build the `duduclaw` binary — see below).
- **macOS**: Docker Desktop only. `build.sh` runs mkosi inside a container
  (`Dockerfile.mkosi-runner`) since mkosi builds GPT disk images with
  loopback/mount operations that don't exist on macOS directly.
  **Docker Desktop memory**: the default VM (8GB RAM / 4 CPUs on a fresh
  install) is tight — `cargo build --release -p duduclaw-cli -p
  duduclaw-gateway` compiling with an uncapped job count OOM-kills partway
  through linking `duduclaw-gateway` (`SIGKILL`, Docker reports it as
  `ResourceExhausted: ... cannot allocate memory` — this was hit on a real
  first build attempt, not a theoretical concern). `build.sh` now caps
  parallelism via `CARGO_JOBS` (default `2`) to work around this, but if
  you still see the OOM, raise Docker Desktop's VM memory (Settings →
  Resources) to **12GB or more**, or lower `CARGO_JOBS` further (`1` is
  the safest floor). Symptom to watch for either way: the `rust-builder`
  stage dies mid-`cargo build` with no Rust compiler error, just a killed
  process.
- **QEMU smoke test** (either OS): `qemu-system-x86_64` and/or
  `qemu-system-aarch64` + OVMF/edk2 UEFI firmware — see below for which
  one you need. macOS: `brew install qemu` installs both. Debian/Ubuntu:
  `apt-get install qemu-system-x86 ovmf` (x86-64 target) and/or
  `apt-get install qemu-system-arm qemu-efi-aarch64` (arm64 target).

## Build

Two build paths, selected by the `APPLIANCE_ARCH` environment variable
(default `x86-64`):

- **Shipping build** (`APPLIANCE_ARCH=x86-64`, the default — no need to
  set it): produces the actual product target. On an amd64 Linux host or
  CI runner this is a same-architecture build (fast, no emulation). On an
  Apple Silicon Mac, `build.sh` now passes `docker build --platform
  linux/amd64` explicitly (previously it silently used the host's native
  platform — on Apple Silicon that meant an aarch64 binary landing in an
  image whose `mkosi.conf` expects x86-64, which cannot run there at all),
  so this path is correct but runs under Docker Desktop's x86-64
  emulation the whole way through, which is slow and is where the memory
  pressure above bites hardest.
- **Local arm64 smoke build** (`APPLIANCE_ARCH=arm64`): builds a
  native-architecture image on an Apple Silicon Mac — no cross-arch
  emulation for either the Rust binary or the mkosi/Debian bootstrap —
  for a fast local QEMU smoke test (with `-accel hvf`, see below) during
  development. This is **not** the shipping target; it exists purely to
  make local iteration on this recipe practical without needing a Linux
  box or CI turnaround for every change.

```sh
appliance/build.sh                       # shipping build: x86-64
APPLIANCE_ARCH=arm64 appliance/build.sh  # local Apple Silicon smoke build
```

This does two things:

1. Builds a Linux `duduclaw` release binary matching `APPLIANCE_ARCH` via
   Docker (reusing `container/Dockerfile.server`'s `rust-builder` stage —
   the same pipeline `scripts/release.sh` already uses to produce Linux
   release binaries, so there's exactly one place that knows how to build
   DuDuClaw for Linux, not two). Skip this by pointing
   `DUDUCLAW_BIN_PATH=/path/to/a/linux/duduclaw` (matching architecture)
   at an already-built binary. `CARGO_JOBS` (default `2`) caps compile
   parallelism to avoid the Docker Desktop OOM described above.
2. Runs `mkosi build --architecture=<arch>`, injecting that binary via
   `--extra-tree=<path>:/usr/local/bin/duduclaw` (natively on Linux, via
   `Dockerfile.mkosi-runner` everywhere else). The architecture-specific
   kernel package (`linux-image-amd64` vs `linux-image-arm64`) is selected
   automatically via `mkosi.conf.d/10-arch-{x86-64,arm64}.conf`.

3. Verifies the A/B layout of the artifact it just produced and derives the
   per-slot UKI pair (`appliance/tools/uki-slots.py`). This step **fails the
   build** rather than warning: it checks that slot A's partition label
   matches `mkosi.version`, that slot B is labelled `_empty`, that the ESP's
   UKI is named `duduclaw-os_<version>.efi`, and that the UKI's baked
   `root=PARTUUID=` really is slot A's. Every one of those is invisible until
   someone tries to update a real machine.

Output lands in `appliance/mkosi.output/`:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `duduclaw-os.raw` | the whole-disk image — the shippable artifact |
| `duduclaw-os.efi` | the UKI, byte-identical to the one inside the ESP |
| `duduclaw-os_<ver>.slot-a.efi` | per-slot UKI, boots root slot A (same bytes as above) |
| `duduclaw-os_<ver>.slot-b.efi` | per-slot UKI, boots root slot B — differs only in the 36 characters of `root=PARTUUID=` |
| `duduclaw-os.vmlinuz` / `.initrd` | the UKI's ingredients, kept for debugging |

The two `.slot-*.efi` files are the A/B update payload's UKI half. They are
built every time but nothing consumes them yet — the signed payload pipeline
is H3d.

One extra build knob exists for the A/B work: `APPLIANCE_BOOT_COUNTING=<1-9>`
sets how many attempts sd-boot gives the factory UKI. It **defaults to 3**
(since H3b, 2026-08-23) — the factory UKI ships as
`duduclaw-os_<ver>+3.efi` and the first healthy boot renames it back to
`duduclaw-os_<ver>.efi`. `APPLIANCE_BOOT_COUNTING=0` builds without counting.
Never above 9: sd-boot v257 does not zero-pad the counter, so a two-digit
value shortens the filename on every rename — the non-atomic-rename hazard the
Boot Loader Specification warns about on FAT32.

## QEMU smoke test

```sh
appliance/smoke-qemu.sh                          # boots an x86-64-built image
APPLIANCE_ARCH=arm64 appliance/smoke-qemu.sh      # boots an arm64-built image
# or: appliance/smoke-qemu.sh path/to/some-other-image.raw
```

`APPLIANCE_ARCH` must match whatever `build.sh` was run with — it selects
both the QEMU binary and the UEFI firmware candidates, not just a display
label.

- `APPLIANCE_ARCH=x86-64` (default): `qemu-system-x86_64`, `q35` machine,
  QEMU's TCG software CPU emulation — slow, but it doesn't need hardware
  virtualization support, so it runs the same way on any build host,
  including cross-architecture (an x86-64 image on an Apple Silicon Mac
  can only ever use TCG here, never hardware acceleration).
- `APPLIANCE_ARCH=arm64`: `qemu-system-aarch64`, `virt` machine. On an
  Apple Silicon host this uses `-accel hvf` (native hardware acceleration
  — fast, the whole point of the local arm64 build path above);
  everywhere else it falls back to TCG like the x86-64 path does.

It passes when the serial console shows both:

- `Reached target Multi-User System` (the OS booted all the way up), and
- some sign `duduclaw-gateway.service` was started (started or failed —
  either proves the unit is wired up; testing that the gateway actually
  *works* needs real model credentials and is out of scope for a boot
  smoke test).

This is a boot-reachability check, not a full functional validation —
first-boot provisioning, A/B updates, USB self-install, and the actual
onboarding flow all need a real machine.

## Boot sequence (what the shipped image actually does)

1. UEFI → systemd-boot picks a UKI (highest boot-counting priority) → root
   mounts read-only from that slot.
2. `duduclaw-usb-install.service`: no-op unless booted from removable
   media with an internal NVMe present (see the script's own header for
   the exact unattended-install safety gate).
3. `duduclaw-firstboot-repart.service`: re-applies the shipped partition
   definitions against the real disk, growing `/data` to fill whatever
   space is available beyond the fixed-size ESP/root-A/root-B.
4. `duduclaw-firstboot-provision.service`: seeds a persisted machine-id
   copy, a placeholder device key, and a minimal `config.toml` (LAN-bound
   dashboard) onto `/data` — then disables itself.
4b. `var-lib-iwd.mount` → `iwd.service`: the mount binds `/var/lib/iwd`
   onto `/data/network/iwd` (source directory guaranteed by
   `usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/duduclaw-network.conf`, which runs before
   `sysinit.target`), then iwd starts and re-joins whatever Wi-Fi network
   was saved. `iwd.service` *requires* the mount, so a failed bind stops
   Wi-Fi loudly instead of quietly writing credentials to a root slot the
   next A/B update discards. IP addressing is systemd-networkd's job
   (`etc/systemd/network/25-wireless-dhcp.network`), not iwd's.
5. `duduclaw-gateway.service` starts, Avahi advertises `duduclaw.local`,
   nftables allows only the dashboard port + mDNS in from the LAN. It now
   also `sd_notify`s systemd (`Type=notify` + `WatchdogSec=60`) once its
   listener is bound, and pings the watchdog every 30s after that — a
   hung-but-still-running process gets killed and restarted, not just a
   crashed one.
6. `duduclaw-kiosk.service`: `ExecCondition=` checks
   `/sys/class/drm/*/status` for any `connected` output. No display
   attached (the common case) → clean skip, nothing else happens. Display
   attached → `seatd.service` (already running by this point) hands DRM
   access to the session compositor, which fullscreens the one and only
   client. See "Kiosk display session" below for which compositor and
   which client, and for the automatic fallback chain between them.
7. `duduclaw-flatpak-setup.service`: creates `/data/flatpak` and adds the
   flathub remote to it (retried on later boots if there's no uplink yet).
   See "Flatpak app layer" below.
8. `duduclaw-health-check.service` (only on boots sd-boot is counting, i.e.
   the first boot after an update or at the factory): probes the gateway's
   `/healthz` and the `duduclaw-sysd` socket for up to 180s. Passing lets
   `boot-complete.target` be reached, which is what runs
   `systemd-bless-boot good` and makes this version permanent; failing leaves
   the counter alone so the next boots decrement it and sd-boot eventually
   falls back to the previous entry. See "A/B updates" below.

## Kiosk display session

Off in effect on every headless box, on automatically the moment a
monitor is attached and the box (re)boots — no config flag either way, see
`mkosi.extra/etc/systemd/system/duduclaw-kiosk.service` for the detection
mechanism and the full device-access chain (`seatd` → `video`/`render`
group membership → compositor → client), each link verified against
upstream/Debian source rather than assumed.

### Which compositor, which client

`duduclaw-kiosk-launch.sh` picks one of three session shapes and falls
back automatically. Nothing here needs a rebuild to change:

| Shape | Compositor | Client | Selected when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `comp` | `duduclaw-comp` (owns DRM/KMS via seatd) | `duduclaw-shell` | both binaries present and comp isn't failure-blacklisted — **the preferred shape, but see the pin below** |
| `cage` | `cage` | `duduclaw-shell` | shell present, comp absent/blacklisted/failed |
| `chromium` | `cage` | Chromium at `http://127.0.0.1:18789` | no shell in the image (the pre-shell behavior, unchanged) |

Which binaries are in the image is a build-time choice:
`DUDUCLAW_SHELL_BIN_PATH=` and `DUDUCLAW_COMP_BIN_PATH=` on `build.sh`
(steps 1c/1d). Neither is built by this repo's build script — both come
from detached workspaces (`crates/duduclaw-shell/BUILD-LINUX.md`,
`crates/duduclaw-comp/BUILD.md`).

**Automatic fallback.** `comp` is attempted, not assumed. The launcher
starts it, waits for its Wayland socket, starts the shell against that
socket, and requires *both* processes to survive a probe window before
calling the session healthy (the socket alone is a weak signal — smithay
creates the listener before the backend is up, so "socket exists" does not
prove comp got the DRM device). Anything short of that → kill both, log
the reason, wait a second for the DRM device to be released, and start the
`cage` shape instead. The journal always says which shape actually ran and
why. Three consecutive early failures write a breadcrumb
(`/data/duduclaw-kiosk/.kiosk-comp-failures`) that makes auto-selection
stop trying comp until it's removed; a healthy session clears it.

**Live-verified (2026-08-22, A4 wave).** The `comp` shape was taken end to
end on the appliance VM against real hardware: libseat session on `seat0`,
`/dev/dri/card0`, connector `Virtual-1` + CRTC, a 1280x800 output, real
pixels on screen, absolute-pointer input landing where it was sent, and
**idle CPU measured at 0.00%** (against `cage`'s ~100% and the winit
backend's 32%) — with `duduclaw-shell` running on it, load average was
0.10 versus 5.6 for the old cage+shell stack. Two defects found in that
round and fixed in the same wave, both of which would have shipped a
box that boots to an unusable screen:

- **comp did not flush Wayland clients unless it rendered.** `flush_clients()`
  sat at the end of the render path, which is skipped whenever nothing is
  dirty — so a client still doing its opening `wl_registry`/`wl_display.sync`
  roundtrip never got the replies (nothing in that roundtrip damages an
  output). The shell hung forever at 0% CPU. Fixed by flushing every event
  loop iteration; idle cost is unchanged.
- **`duduclaw-shell` received no keyboard or pointer events at all.** Root
  cause is client-side: gpui's Wayland backend stores exactly one seat
  (`gpui_linux/.../wayland/client.rs:309` is literally
  `// TODO: Multi seat support`) and each new seat's capabilities event
  *releases* the previous seat's keyboard/pointer — so the shell was left
  holding the co-drive **agent** seat while focus lives on the human seat.
  comp advertises two `wl_seat` globals on purpose (that separation is what
  makes freeze/e-stop structurally agent-only), so the fix is
  `seat_order.rs`: advertise the agent seat FIRST so gpui's last-wins lands
  on the human seat. Zero change to the co-drive safety model. Override with
  `DUDUCLAW_COMP_SEAT_ORDER=human-first` (which reproduces the broken state
  exactly, useful as an A/B). Known cost: a gpui client can no longer be
  agent-driven, since it releases the agent seat's resources; every other
  client keeps both seats (`foot` re-verified under the new order).
  The upstream gpui patch is written up in `crates/duduclaw-comp/BUILD.md`
  for whenever a zed fork exists to carry it.

**Escape hatches** (drop a file from a serial/debug session, then
`systemctl restart duduclaw-kiosk.service` — no image rebuild):

- `/etc/duduclaw/kiosk-app` — one word, forces the shape: `chromium`,
  `comp`, or `cage` (`shell` is accepted as the historical spelling of
  `cage`). Checked before everything else, including the blacklist.
- `/etc/duduclaw/kiosk.env` — optional shell fragment, sourced with
  `set -a`. Knobs: `DUDUCLAW_KIOSK_DBUS=0`,
  `DUDUCLAW_KIOSK_COMP_MAX_FAILURES`,
  `DUDUCLAW_KIOSK_COMP_SOCKET_WAIT_SECS`,
  `DUDUCLAW_KIOSK_COMP_SHELL_PROBE_SECS`, `DUDUCLAW_COMP_BACKEND`.

**Session D-Bus bus.** This unit is a plain system service, not a
PAM/logind session, so nothing would otherwise create a session bus. The
launcher re-execs itself under `dbus-run-session` so the whole session
tree shares one, and pushes `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`/
`XDG_SESSION_TYPE` into the bus's activation environment once the
compositor is up — without that, a D-Bus-activated `xdg-desktop-portal`
would be spawned with no idea where the display is. Fail-open: if
`dbus-run-session` isn't installed the session starts exactly as before
and says so in the journal (Flatpak apps then have no portal support).

**Don't set `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE` on the compositor.** Mesa refuses
("Not allowed to force software rendering when API explicitly selects a
hardware device") and the compositor segfaults. It was found this way with
`cage`; the same rule now points at `duduclaw-comp`.

**Estimated cost** (not measured on real hardware this round — flagged as
an estimate per the task, not a benchmark result):

- **Image size**: Chromium dominates — Debian trixie's `chromium` package
  alone is ~87.5 MB download / **~317 MB installed** on amd64
  ([packages.debian.org](https://packages.debian.org/trixie/chromium)).
  `cage` + `seatd` + the `xwayland`/`libwlroots-0.18` stack `cage` pulls in
  add well under 5 MB combined (`cage` itself is ~21 KB, `seatd` ~27 KB,
  `xwayland` ~883 KB download-size — the wlroots shared libraries are the
  only non-trivial addition beyond Chromium, still an order of magnitude
  smaller than it). Rough total: **image grows by roughly 320–340 MB**
  regardless of whether a display is ever actually attached (packages are
  installed either way; only the *running* cost is detection-gated).
- **RAM**: not independently measured this round — a single Chromium tab
  rendering a dashboard-weight web app typically lands somewhere in the
  **300–600 MB** range in general practice (varies heavily with page
  complexity, extensions — none installed here — and GPU compositing
  path), plus `cage`/`seatd`'s own footprint (tens of MB, wlroots
  compositors are lightweight). Only paid when a display is attached and
  the unit actually starts; headless boxes pay nothing beyond the
  binaries already sitting unused on disk.

## A/B updates — what is wired as of H3c

Full design and rollout order:
`commercial/docs/DESIGN-ab-update-rollback-2026-08.md`. What is actually in
the image today:

| Piece | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Two equal-sized root slots + separate `/data` | `mkosi.repart/` | ✅ since the first image |
| `systemd-sysupdate` (writes a payload into the free slot, keeps the version ledger) | `Packages=systemd-container` | ✅ H3a — **was missing from every earlier image** |
| `systemd-bless-boot` (marks a boot successful) | `Packages=systemd-boot` | ✅ H3a — **was missing from every earlier image** |
| Transfer definitions (`.transfer`, arch-generic, boot-counting-aware) | `mkosi.extra/etc/sysupdate.d/` | ✅ H3a |
| Per-slot UKI: each UKI boots its own root slot | `mkosi.conf` `root=PARTUUID` + `tools/uki-slots.py` | ✅ H3a |
| Boot counting armed on the factory UKI | `APPLIANCE_BOOT_COUNTING=` (default **3**) | ✅ H3b — on by default since 2026-08-23 |
| Health gate deciding what "a successful boot" means | `duduclaw-health-check.service` + `usr/local/sbin/duduclaw-health-check.sh` | ✅ H3c |
| Signed payload pipeline (independent OS key) | — | ⬜ H3d |
| `device.update_rollback` doing something | `duduclaw-sysd` | ⬜ H3f — still returns `Unsupported` |

Two things are worth understanding before touching this area.

**The ESP holds one UKI at a time, not two.** Each release builds a *pair* of
UKIs (`duduclaw-os_<ver>.slot-a.efi` / `.slot-b.efi` in `mkosi.output/`)
differing only in the `root=PARTUUID=` baked into the cmdline, but only the
one matching the destination slot is ever installed. A second entry appears in
`/EFI/Linux` only while an update is pending — the new version's entry
alongside the old one, which is exactly what gives sd-boot something to fall
back to. Shipping a second entry at the factory would mean shipping a boot
entry pointing at an empty partition.

**The ordering between H3a, H3b and H3c is not interchangeable.** Boot
counting without `systemd-bless-boot` is worse than no boot counting: sd-boot
decrements the counter on every boot and nothing ever resets it, so a
perfectly healthy machine marks its own only boot entry bad on the third
reboot. That is why the binaries landed first (H3a), the counter was armed
second (H3b), and the gate that decides what "successful" means landed with it
(H3c). `APPLIANCE_BOOT_COUNTING` now defaults to **3**; `=0` builds an image
with no counting at all, which is a bisecting tool, not a shipping shape.

**What blesses a boot.** sd-boot renames `duduclaw-os_<ver>+3.efi` to
`+2-1` *before* starting it, so the counter is already spent by the time
userspace runs. Clearing it requires reaching `boot-complete.target`, and
`duduclaw-health-check.service` is `RequiredBy=` that target — so the sequence
is: gateway `/healthz` returns 200 with `"ok":true` (which also covers the
cron/heartbeat schedulers, not just the HTTP listener) **and**
`/run/duduclaw/sysd.sock` accepts a connection ⇒ `boot-complete.target` ⇒
`systemd-bless-boot good` ⇒ the filename loses its suffix and the version is
permanent. Fail any of that and nothing clears the counter, so the next boots
decrement it and sd-boot falls back to the previous entry. Deliberately *not*
gated on: network reachability, the compositor/shell (headless is the primary
shape), and `systemd-boot-check-no-failures` (upstream itself says it is not
suitable as a deployment criterion). Budget is 180s, set as
`Environment=DUDUCLAW_HEALTH_TIMEOUT=` in the unit.

Two tests cover this, both runnable without a real machine:

```sh
python3 appliance/tests/ab-update/health_check_test.py            # host-only: the gate's decision logic
appliance/tests/ab-update/boot-ab.sh &                            # VM (fresh disk each run)
python3 -u appliance/tests/ab-update/h3bc_probe.py t0             # counting is real + this boot got blessed
python3 -u appliance/tests/ab-update/h3bc_probe.py t1             # 3 healthy reboots must NOT drift into a rollback
python3 -u appliance/tests/ab-update/h3bc_probe.py t4             # the gate must also be able to say NO
python3 -u appliance/tests/ab-update/h3bc_probe.py esp            # T9: real three-UKI ESP peak
python3 -u appliance/tests/ab-update/h3bc_probe.py inject         # stage an unbootable "update"
python3 -u appliance/tests/ab-update/h3bc_probe.py t3             # T3: it must roll back on its own
```

(`-u` matters: the probe drives a serial console for minutes at a time and
block-buffered stdout hides all of it until the run ends.)

Run `t0` **before** anything else: if boot counting silently no-ops (an
unwritable ESP does exactly that, with no error anywhere), a rollback test
still "passes" without ever having counted anything — the most misleading
result this area can produce.

## Flatpak app layer

Third-party desktop apps run as Flatpaks. Three packages are installed
(`flatpak`, `xdg-desktop-portal`, `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk`) and
`xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` deliberately is not: Screenshot/ScreenCast
backends forward frames captured through `wlr-screencopy`, and
`duduclaw-comp` implements no screen-capture protocol, so that package
would be dead weight rather than a partial win. Everything behind these
choices — including a live container run of a real Flathub Chromium
against `duduclaw-comp` with **zero** portal backends installed, which
started and rendered fine — is written up in
`research/native-os-2026-08/flatpak-portal-scope-2026-08.md`.

**The app repository lives on `/data`, never on root.** A single Chromium
plus the freedesktop runtime measures 2.4 GB on disk; the root partition
is a fixed 5 GB with well under 1.4 GB free. `mkosi.extra/etc/flatpak/
installations.d/10-duduclaw-data.conf` declares a named installation
`data` at `/data/flatpak`, and it ships as static image content precisely
because it has to be in place *before* the first `flatpak install` — the
repository layout is created by that first install, and once it lands in
`/var/lib/flatpak` moving it is surgery.

**Every command needs `--installation=data`.** This adds an installation;
it does not move the default one. A bare `flatpak install <app>` still
targets `/var/lib/flatpak` on the root partition and will fill it.

```bash
flatpak --installation=data list
flatpak remote-ls --installation=data flathub
flatpak install --installation=data flathub org.libreoffice.LibreOffice
```

`duduclaw-flatpak-setup.service` runs on every boot and does three things,
all idempotent: create `/data/flatpak` (refusing to proceed if `/data`
isn't actually mounted), write a default sandbox environment
(`XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland`), and add the flathub remote. Only the last
needs the network, so it retries and is stamped once it succeeds — a box
that first booted without an uplink picks it up on a later boot rather
than needing operator action.

Two measured findings worth keeping in view:

- **`flatpak override` cannot target a named installation.** On flatpak
  1.16.6, in both documented option positions, it exits 0, prints no
  warning, reads the value straight back with `--show` — and writes to
  `/var/lib/flatpak/overrides/global`, which no app under `/data` reads.
  The setup script therefore writes `/data/flatpak/overrides/global`
  itself, in flatpak's own file format.
- **Wayland is not auto-selected by Chromium-family apps.** With
  `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` already exported, Flathub's Chromium still picked the
  X11 ozone backend and failed; it needs an explicit
  `--ozone-platform=wayland`. That is argv, and no environment variable
  expresses it, so the durable fix belongs to whatever launches the app
  (a per-app-id argv policy in DuDuClaw's own launcher) — not to an edited
  `.desktop` file inside the app, which the next `flatpak update` deletes.

**Size**: the three packages cost **113.5 MB** installed *on top of this
image's existing package set* (86 new packages, no recommends — measured
by diffing the apt dependency closure with and without them, not
estimated). The 2.4 GB figure above is app/runtime content and lands on
`/data`.

## Known open points

Verified against upstream documentation where noted inline in each file;
these specific points were **not** independently confirmed by an actual
build or boot this round (per the current task scope: recipe + scripts
only, no live image build) and are the first things worth checking once a
real Linux build environment is available:

- ~~**Non-verity root=PARTUUID auto-wiring.**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-08-23 (H3a),
  and the assumption was WRONG.** mkosi does not auto-embed `root=PARTUUID=`
  for a plain non-verity root: it only substitutes the bare literal token
  `root=PARTUUID` when that token appears as a standalone word in
  `KernelCommandLine=` (mkosi 25.3, `finalize_cmdline()`). It was not there,
  so every image built before this date shipped a UKI whose `.cmdline` had no
  `root=` at all — read directly out of the `.cmdline` PE section of
  `mkosi.output/duduclaw-os.efi`. Those images booted because
  `systemd-gpt-auto-generator` picked the root by comparing partition labels,
  which is also why slot B's `NoAuto=yes` attribute was load-bearing. The
  token is now in `mkosi.conf` and `build.sh` asserts after every build that
  the UKI's baked PARTUUID really is slot A's.
- **`systemd-repart` re-run against a live, already-populated root-A
  partition.** Reasoned to be a safe no-op (repart resizes/creates,
  doesn't recreate an already-matching partition — see the comment in
  `duduclaw-firstboot-repart.sh`), but not observed in an actual run.
- **machine-id stability across reboots on a read-only root.** The
  persistence approach in `duduclaw-firstboot-provision.sh` copies
  whatever ID the current boot has to `/data`; whether systemd's own
  early machine-id generation runs too early in boot for any regular unit
  to intercept and override it on *subsequent* boots (making every boot
  get a fresh transient ID instead of the persisted one) is flagged
  in-line as a real open question, not assumed solved.
- **A/B boot-counting ↔ `systemd-sysupdate` interaction.** Half resolved
  2026-08-23 (H3a). The sysupdate half is now traced end-to-end and
  live-fire verified against real `systemd-sysupdate` 257.13: with `@l`/`@d`
  wildcards in the target `MatchPattern=` plus `TriesLeft=3`/`TriesDone=0`, a
  transfer installs the UKI as `duduclaw-os_<ver>+3-0.efi`, and a partition
  transfer writes into the `_empty` slot, relabels it with the new version
  and clears the no-auto attribute. The other half — sd-boot decrementing the
  counter and `systemd-bless-boot` clearing it after a healthy boot — was
  armed in H3b (`APPLIANCE_BOOT_COUNTING`, now default 3) once the binaries
  were in the image (H3a's `systemd-boot` package) and once something decided
  what "healthy" means (H3c's `duduclaw-health-check.service`). Arming it
  without both of those is strictly worse than leaving it off: nothing would
  ever clear the counter and a healthy machine would roll itself back on the
  3rd reboot. See the "A/B updates" section above for the verification
  commands.
- **OVMF/edk2 firmware paths in `smoke-qemu.sh`.** The macOS/Homebrew
  candidates (both x86-64 and arm64) were confirmed by actually running
  `brew install qemu` and listing `$(brew --prefix qemu)/share/qemu/`
  (qemu 11.1.0, arm64_tahoe bottle, 2026-08) — those specific filenames
  are real, not guessed. The Debian/apt candidates (`/usr/share/OVMF/*`
  for x86-64, `/usr/share/AAVMF/*` for arm64) are still best-effort:
  several candidate paths are tried since exact filenames vary by
  distro/package version, and the Linux ones specifically weren't
  independently confirmed this round.
- ~~**`mkosi.repart/` partition types are x86-64-only.**~~ **RESOLVED.** The
  repart drop-ins already used the generic `Type=root` (which systemd
  resolves to the running architecture's native root type), and H3a
  finished the job on the update side: `10-duduclaw-root.transfer` now uses
  the same generic `MatchPartitionType=root` and the architecture-templated
  source pattern `duduclaw-os_@v.root-%a.raw`, instead of the hardcoded
  `root-x86-64` that matched nothing on an arm64 build. Note the trap that
  makes this worth stating: `MatchPartitionType=` does **not** expand
  specifiers, and a value it cannot parse is ignored with a warning and
  falls back to `linux-generic` — so `root-%a` there would silently target
  the `/data` partition. Only `MatchPattern=` takes `%a`.
- **`SSH disabled by default` via system-preset.** The skeleton-tree
  ordering this depends on (preset file must exist before
  `openssh-server`'s postinst runs) is documented mkosi behavior, but the
  resulting preset outcome wasn't observed against a real Debian
  `openssh-server` install.
- **`ExtraTrees=mkosi.repart:/usr/lib/repart.d` composing correctly**
  alongside mkosi's own auto-discovered `mkosi.extra/` tree (both are
  `ExtraTrees=` entries, expected to append per mkosi's list-setting
  semantics) — not exercised by an actual build.
- **Kiosk display session, end-to-end.** Every individual piece (package
  names, the `/sys/class/drm/*/status` values, the `seatd -g video` /
  render-node-group requirement, `ExecCondition=`'s skip-not-fail
  semantics, the `cage`/Chromium flag strings) is verified against
  upstream or Debian source this round — see
  `mkosi.extra/etc/systemd/system/duduclaw-kiosk.service`'s own comment
  block for the citations — but the pieces have never been run together
  against real DRM/KMS hardware. Specific sub-points still open:
  - `seatd`'s own VT-allocation behavior beyond the one explicit
    `Conflicts=getty@tty1.service` handled here (e.g. interaction with an
    autovt unit on some *other* VT) wasn't traced end-to-end.
  - Chromium's own sandbox (unprivileged user namespaces) running under
    this unit's `NoNewPrivileges=yes` — expected to be compatible (the
    namespace sandbox doesn't need the legacy SUID-sandbox privilege
    escalation `NoNewPrivileges=` blocks), not confirmed by an actual run.
  - Whether Debian's `chromium` package auto-detects a Wayland session
    without `--ozone-platform=wayland` was not tested either way; the flag
    is passed explicitly so the outcome doesn't depend on that
    auto-detection succeeding.
  - The Chromium enterprise policy file
    (`mkosi.extra/etc/chromium/policies/managed/duduclaw-kiosk.json`) has
    its path and key name verified against Chromium source
    (`policy_paths.cc`, `config_dir_policy_loader.cc`,
    `translate_url_fetcher.cc`'s own traffic-annotation example), but
    Chromium actually picking it up was not observed on a real boot.

- **`duduclaw-comp` as the session compositor, on real hardware.** The
  selection + fallback decision tree in `duduclaw-kiosk-launch.sh` is
  verified — 31 assertions, in a Debian trixie container against stub
  binaries covering comp-dies-instantly, the three-strike blacklist, all
  three escape-hatch tokens, a junk token, a healthy comp handing a real
  Unix socket to its client, a missing binary, and the no-shell path — but
  a *stub* is not a compositor. Two things it therefore cannot prove:
  - `duduclaw-comp`'s own DRM/udev backend. That is being implemented in
    parallel (A4-1); this wiring assumes the contract "no `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
    in the environment ⇒ take the hardware", with `DUDUCLAW_COMP_BACKEND`
    passed explicitly on top so the target is never implicit. A comp build
    that ignores that variable still gets the same path from the unset
    `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`; a comp build that wants a *different* variable name
    needs one line changed in `run_comp_session`.
  - Whether the compositor's socket appears where the launcher looks
    (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-*`, matched by "is a socket" rather than by
    name, so a rename can't silently break it) once the winit backend is
    no longer the one creating it.
- **`dbus-run-session`'s package provenance.** The `dbus` package is
  already installed and is expected to pull the binary in transitively,
  but which Debian trixie binary package actually ships
  `/usr/bin/dbus-run-session` was not confirmed. The launcher degrades
  cleanly (no session bus, journal line, everything else unchanged) rather
  than failing, so the first boot's journal answers this; if it is absent,
  add `dbus-bin` to `mkosi.conf`'s `Packages=`.
- **Input devices under `duduclaw-comp`.** The kiosk user is deliberately
  *not* in the `input` group, because a libseat-based compositor never
  opens `/dev/input/event*` itself — seatd does, exactly as it already
  does for `cage` on this image. If a comp build reaches libinput without
  going through libseat it will see zero keyboards and zero pointers; the
  fix is `input` in the `useradd -G` list in
  `postinst.d/20-users-and-units.sh`. Recorded so the first failing boot
  is one step, not five.
- **Root partition headroom is arithmetic, not a measurement.** The "~3.6 GB
  used of 5 GB" baseline comes from `mkosi.repart/20-root-a.conf`'s own
  comment, not from `df` on a built image. Against it, the A4 additions are
  113.5 MB (flatpak trio, measured) plus the `duduclaw-comp` binary
  (~146 MB as an unstripped debug build, materially less stripped or built
  release) — so no partition resize, with roughly 1 GB still free. If a
  build ever dies with "No space left on device while populating file
  system", the levers in order are: `APPLIANCE_STRIP` (on by default —
  check the build log actually reported a strip rather than a warning),
  handing in a release build of the two binaries, then raising `SizeMinBytes=`
  /`SizeMaxBytes=` in **both** `20-root-a.conf` and `21-root-b.conf`
  together (A/B slots must stay identical for sysupdate).

None of these are silently assumed solved; each is called out at its
source in the relevant file's comments as well, so nothing here is a
surprise if you go read the recipe itself.

## Explicitly out of scope for this recipe

- Actually building or shipping an image (this round is recipe + scripts
  only — see the task notes above).
- Secure Boot signing / dm-verity root integrity (read-only mount + GPT
  read-only attribute is the current integrity story).
- ~~Wi-Fi provisioning (wired DHCP only).~~ **No longer out of scope as of
  2026-08-23 (D4a).** The image now ships `iwd` (802.11 association) +
  `systemd-networkd` (IP layer, `etc/systemd/network/25-wireless-dhcp.network`),
  with credentials bind-mounted onto the data partition
  (`etc/systemd/system/var-lib-iwd.mount` + `usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/
  duduclaw-network.conf`) so an A/B update cannot orphan them. The gateway
  drives iwd over D-Bus as a member of the `netdev` group; the shell reaches it
  through the gateway's RPC and is deliberately NOT in that group. Selection
  reasoning, measurements and the permission topology:
  `commercial/docs/DESIGN-network-settings-2026-08.md`.
  **Still incomplete:** no `firmware-*` package is installed yet (decision
  D-③ — waiting on the real N305 / 8845HS boxes to know which one), so a real
  machine's Wi-Fi NIC has drivers but no firmware and will not initialize. The
  `non-free-firmware` component is already enabled in `mkosi.conf`, so adding
  the right package is a one-line change. Until then Wi-Fi works under
  `mac80211_hwsim` (see `tests/wifi-hwsim/`) and reports `driver_missing` on
  real hardware rather than failing silently.
- Kiosk hot-plug re-detection (a display attached after boot needs a
  restart of `duduclaw-kiosk.service` to be picked up — see "Kiosk display
  session" above; the detection itself, gated on boot, is implemented).
- The real update-channel infrastructure `mkosi.extra/etc/sysupdate.d/`
  transfers assume (they're written for a local staging directory today,
  not a signed remote release feed).

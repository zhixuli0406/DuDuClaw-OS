//! Token-budget enforcement pipeline (#12, 2026-05-12).
//!
//! Before #12, the 200 K cliff was diagnosed *after* the request was sent
//! (via `cost_telemetry::record` + `cost_pressure` event). Operators got a
//! warning but the next request still went through unchanged. Budget
//! enforcement closes this loop: at the request boundary, estimate the
//! total input tokens; if over the configured ceiling, walk a fixed
//! compression pipeline. If the pipeline can't bring it under, refuse
//! the request and emit a `budget_exceeded` event.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! - **Pure stage functions** — each stage takes `(system, history, user)`
//!   and either returns a compressed version or `None` (stage can't help
//!   further). Callers iterate stages in order until budget is met.
//! - **Cost-pressure aware** — when an agent has a hot `cost_pressure`
//!   flag (#6.3), early stages become more aggressive (e.g. TurnTrim
//!   threshold drops from 800 → 200 chars).
//! - **Token estimation** uses a CJK-aware heuristic (1.306 tokens/char
//!   for CJK text, 1 token per 3.6 chars otherwise — 2026-08 local-corpus
//!   calibration; see `estimate_tokens` below for why the old uniform
//!   1.5 chars/token guess underestimated usage by ~22%).
//!
//! ## Stages
//!
//! Stages are ordered from cheapest / least lossy to most aggressive:
//! 1. `TurnTrim` — per-turn 800/200-char tail trim (existing approach,
//!    just made explicit). Loses no semantic content for short replies.
//! 2. `DropOldestToolEchoes` — strip the full content of tool results
//!    older than the last 3 turns, replace with a `[tool_result.id=N]`
//!    stub. Tool results are recoverable via MCP when needed.
//! 3. `BisectAndSummarize` — last resort. Take the older half of history,
//!    summarize via Haiku async into ~500 chars of bullets. This stage
//!    is currently a stub; full impl belongs to #13.
//!
//! ## What's intentionally NOT here
//!
//! - **LlmLingua-2 bridge**: CLAUDE.md mentions this as available infra
//!   but the Python subprocess startup latency makes it a poor fit for
//!   per-request synchronous compression. Should live in #13's async
//!   summarizer instead.
//! - **Meta-token LTSC**: a separate, opt-in `[compression]` config
//!   knob since it costs decode time on the agent side. Deferred.

// ── WP5: cache-aware compression gate (2607.12161) ─────────────────────
//
// The pipeline above is purely token-budget driven — it has no notion of
// prompt-cache health. That's a problem for agents whose system prompt +
// history are already hitting a healthy cache (Anthropic `cache_control:
// ephemeral`): rewriting even a small tail of the history changes the
// bytes the cache is keyed on, which forces a full cache-prefix rebuild.
// The paper's empirical finding is that cache-rebuild cost dominates
// (~87%) the overhead in that regime, i.e. the tokens compression saves
// are smaller than the cache-miss tax it triggers. `should_skip_for_cache`
// is the deterministic gate `maybe_compress_history` (channel_reply.rs)
// consults before entering the pipeline at all.

/// Compression info threaded from `maybe_compress_history` down to the
/// eventual `cost_telemetry` record call, which happens several async
/// frames away (inside `spawn_claude_cli_with_env` / the PTY variant).
/// Mirrors the existing `CHANNEL_REPLY_AGENT_ID` / `CHANNEL_REPLY_USER_ID`
/// task-locals in `claude_runner.rs` — same problem, same fix shape.

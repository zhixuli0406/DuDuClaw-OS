//! P4-4: digital-footprint memory distillation.
//!
//! Turns the OS-perception event stream (`os_file` / `os_frontmost`, wired by
//! `os_events.rs` / `os_frontmost.rs`) into **temporal memory**, so an agent
//! accumulates a durable, low-noise picture of how its user works — which
//! apps dominate the day, which project directories are active, when the user
//! tends to be active — instead of either ignoring the signal or writing a
//! memory row per raw event (which would flood the store: hundreds of
//! file-saves and window switches happen in a normal working day).
//!
//! Methodology: *Memory for Autonomous LLM Agents* (arXiv:2603.07670) —
//! "write the digital footprint into the existing temporal store, let
//! Ebbinghaus retrievability (`R = exp(-t/S)`) surface what's actually being
//! recalled" — not a new memory subsystem (§②-5 of
//! `research-os-native-agent-methodology.md`: OS-Copilot's declarative/
//! procedural split says facts belong in the existing three-way memory model,
//! never a perception-specific table).
//!
//! ## Design: aggregate in memory, distill once a day
//!
//! [`FootprintTracker`] subscribes to the same autopilot broadcast bus the
//! interruptibility tracker and CEP matcher read, and accumulates **per
//! agent, per UTC day**:
//! - foreground-app *time* (seconds each app was frontmost, accumulated on
//!   each app switch — the interval between two `os_frontmost` events),
//! - active *directory* counts (the containing directory of each `os_file`
//!   path — **never the file name**, data minimization),
//! - an *hour-of-day* activity histogram (UTC).
//!
//! A background ticker ([`FootprintTracker::spawn_distill_loop`]) checks every
//! [`DISTILL_CHECK_INTERVAL`] whether a tracked agent's accumulated day is
//! before "today" (UTC). When it is, the finalized day is **distilled** into
//! up to three deterministic `(subject="user", predicate, object)` triples and
//! written via [`SqliteMemoryEngine::store_temporal`] — never per-event, so
//! the write rate is O(agents × days), not O(events). The existing
//! `(subject, predicate)` supersession chain means today's `daily_active_app`
//! fact automatically closes out yesterday's while `get_history` still exposes
//! the full trail (`R=exp(-t/S)` then ranks by how often that trail keeps
//! getting reaffirmed/searched, per the Ebbinghaus retrievability already in
//! `duduclaw-memory`).
//!
//! The ticker starting at gateway boot (rather than a cron-style fixed
//! midnight trigger) is deliberately what "UTC 日界或 gateway 啟動補跑" means
//! here: startup restores the snapshot (see below) — a yesterday-dated
//! restored bucket distills on the ticker's first pass — and the loop then
//! keeps checking date rollover regardless of what time of day the gateway
//! happened to start, so a long-running process naturally distills every UTC
//! midnight it lives through.
//!
//! ## Opt-in, additive, in-memory only
//!
//! - Per-agent opt-in: `[os_watch] footprint = true` (deny-by-default, layered
//!   ON TOP of `os_native` / `[os_watch] paths` — an agent with filesystem
//!   watching on does NOT get footprint memory unless it also sets this flag).
//!   Read via [`read_footprint_enabled`]; only agents that had it set **at
//!   gateway startup** are tracked — no hot-reload (same documented tradeoff
//!   as `os_frontmost`'s `frontmost_poll_secs` polling, P2-4: "a future pass
//!   can add a stoppable registry symmetric with `OsWatcherRegistry`"). This
//!   is also the aggregation-side half of deny-by-default: an agent that never
//!   opted in is never even added to the in-memory tracking map, not merely
//!   skipped at write time — data minimization starts at collection, not just
//!   at persistence.
//! - Aggregation state lives in memory (`std::sync::Mutex` over a `HashMap`,
//!   never held across an `.await`) with a crash/restart snapshot: every
//!   distill tick persists each bucket to
//!   `<home>/os/<agent>/footprint-aggregate.json` (atomic tmp+rename) and
//!   startup restores it — a restart loses at most one
//!   [`DISTILL_CHECK_INTERVAL`] of accumulation, not the whole day (the
//!   pre-2026-07-29 memory-only design meant a frequently-restarted gateway
//!   never distilled anything).
//! - Every piece of perceived text (app name, directory path) is passed
//!   through `sanitize_perception_text` before it is ever used as an
//!   aggregation key or written to memory — the same P2-5 perception boundary
//!   every other OS-sensing path uses.
//! - File paths are reduced to their **containing directory** before anything
//!   else happens to them — [`directory_of`] runs on the raw path, so the file
//!   name itself is never even looked at, let alone aggregated or stored
//!   (stronger than sanitizing-then-truncating a full path: the highest-risk
//!   substring — the file name, "quarterly-layoffs-draft.docx" — is dropped
//!   at the source, not merely neutralized).
//!
//! ## Origin + sensitivity (v1.41 write-time binding, P3-2)
//!
//! Every write is stamped `origin = "agent_derived"` (trust ceiling `0.6`,
//! `duduclaw_memory::origin::AGENT_DERIVED`) — this is background-pipeline
//! *derived* content (a deterministic aggregation over raw OS signals), not
//! something the user typed (`user_direct`, ceiling `1.0`) nor a raw tool
//! echo (`tool_echo`, ceiling `0.5`); it is the same shape as reflexion
//! consolidation / night consolidation, which is exactly what
//! `AGENT_DERIVED`'s doc comment lists as its intended callers.
//!
//! Each written row also carries a [`Sensitivity`] label in `metadata` via
//! `duduclaw_memory::stamp_sensitivity_metadata` — the P3-2 write-side hook
//! this module is the first production caller of:
//! - `daily_active_app` / `active_hours` are identity-bound behavioral
//!   signals → [`Sensitivity::Personal`] (mirrors the P3-2 perception-source
//!   table's `frontmost` = Personal rule — both ultimately derive from the
//!   same `os_frontmost` sensing source; `active_hours` reveals *when* a
//!   specific person works, which is the same category of exposure as a
//!   calendar, also classified Personal).
//! - `active_directory` is workspace/operational → [`Sensitivity::Internal`]
//!   (mirrors the P3-2 table's `os_file` = Internal rule).
//!
//! **Known limitation, stated precisely:** no consumer currently reads
//! memory-row `sensitivity` metadata to gate `memory_search` / `search_layer`
//! results by session privacy — P3-2 shipped its context-collapse defence at
//! the persona-block (`## Key Facts About This User`, `## About This User`)
//! and wiki-namespace layers only, both of which gate on `is_private_session`
//! *before* ever querying memory, not by filtering already-returned rows. This
//! module supplies the correctly-labelled write side that such a future
//! retrieval-side gate can key off (`duduclaw_memory::read_sensitivity_metadata`
//! + `Sensitivity::allowed_in_session`); the accompanying test proves that
//! composition is correct for these three predicates specifically, without
//! claiming a `channel_reply.rs`-level consumer exists yet.

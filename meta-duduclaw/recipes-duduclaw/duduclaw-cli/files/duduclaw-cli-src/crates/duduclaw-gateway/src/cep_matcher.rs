//! P3-3 lightweight CEP (Complex Event Processing) — in-process time-window
//! sequence matcher on top of the existing autopilot event bus.
//!
//! ## What this is
//!
//! `autopilot_engine` dispatches on a *single* event: `trigger_event ==
//! event_name && evaluate(conditions, fields)`. This module adds a second,
//! independent dispatch shape — a **temporal pattern** over two events:
//!
//! > event `A` (matching `first`), then within `within_secs` seconds event
//! > `B` (matching `then`) — fire (or, with `negate: true`, fire only if `B`
//! > does **not** show up within the window).
//!
//! `research-os-native-agent-methodology.md` §3.1 / §②-7 point at arXiv
//! 2501.00906 (Autogen+Kafka CEP pipeline) for the *concept* only — that
//! paper's actual application domain is multimedia IoT video querying, not a
//! general CEP framework (`[verified-caveat]`, see the methodology doc's
//! citation table), and the project's explicit decision (§ risk list) is to
//! **not** pull in a streaming platform (Kafka/Flink/Autogen) for this. The
//! pattern matcher here is 100% deterministic Rust — no LLM is ever asked to
//! reason about "did A happen before B" (the same source material warns LLM
//! temporal reasoning is error-prone).
//!
//! ## Design (in-process, not durable)
//!
//! - State (`pending` map) lives entirely in memory. A gateway restart loses
//!   any in-flight sequence windows — this is an accepted trade-off for a
//!   lightweight, dependency-free implementation (documented, not silent).
//!   `events.db` itself is untouched and unread by this module; it already
//!   has its own retention/pruning independent of CEP state.
//! - Every rule with a non-null `sequence` column is evaluated against
//!   **every** event that flows over the autopilot broadcast bus. Rules are
//!   re-read from `AutopilotStore` per event (same pattern
//!   `AutopilotEngine::process_event` already uses for ordinary rules), so a
//!   newly created/edited sequence rule takes effect on the next event
//!   without a restart.
//! - A resolved pattern is turned into a synthetic
//!   [`AutopilotEvent::CepTrigger`] re-broadcast onto the **same** bus this
//!   matcher subscribes to. `AutopilotEngine::process_event` special-cases
//!   that variant: it looks the rule up by id and fires it directly
//!   (circuit breaker, `execute_action`, history/activity — the exact same
//!   tail as an ordinary rule match), so `proactive_notify` still goes
//!   through `ProactiveGate` and nothing bypasses the existing action gates.
//!
//! ## Known limitation (by design, not a gap to silently paper over)
//!
//! `first`/`then` `match` conditions can only compare a field to a **static**
//! literal (the same shape as ordinary autopilot `conditions`) — there is no
//! cross-event correlation (e.g. "the SAME `agent_id` that started the
//! window"). A rule author who needs that must include an explicit
//! `{"field":"agent_id","op":"eq","value":"<literal>"}` in both `first.match`
//! and `then.match`. This mirrors the existing `evaluate()` condition
//! language exactly (no new operators invented) and keeps the matcher's
//! surface area small and auditable.

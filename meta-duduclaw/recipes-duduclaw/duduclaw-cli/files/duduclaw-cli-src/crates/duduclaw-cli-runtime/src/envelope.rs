//! In-band sentinel framing protocol for CLI request / response.
//!
//! The PTY stream is a single byte sequence shared by the human-readable TUI render,
//! ANSI escapes, and the model's final answer. To extract the final answer reliably
//! without scrolling-back scraping (the brittle approach `maude` and friends take),
//! we ask the CLI — via system-prompt injection — to wrap its final response in a
//! magic sentinel that includes the request UUID:
//!
//! ```text
//! =====DUDUCLAW.RSP.550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.MARK=====
//! ...answer payload...
//! =====DUDUCLAW.RSP.550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000.MARK=====
//! ```
//!
//! Sentinel design constraints:
//! - **High uniqueness**: a 36-char UUID makes accidental collision with model output
//!   astronomically unlikely.
//! - **Markdown-safe**: the original `<<<...>>>` sentinel was mangled by the
//!   Claude TUI's markdown renderer (which ate one `<` and one `>` per side,
//!   treating it as an HTML tag — verified in the 2026-05-14 spike). The new
//!   `=====...=====` sentinel survives the renderer intact.
//! - **Chunk-boundary tolerant**: parsers accumulate into a buffer and only commit
//!   once both sentinels are found.
//! - **UTF-8 safe**: all string slicing uses `char_indices` / `find`, never raw byte
//!   ranges that could split a multi-byte codepoint.
//! - **CRLF tolerant**: Windows ConPTY may inject CRLF — strip on parse.
//! - **ANSI-tolerant via [`strip_ansi`]**: callers strip CSI/OSC sequences before
//!   scanning so the sentinel's contiguous-byte structure is preserved (the TUI
//!   interleaves `ESC[1C` cursor-forward codes between every visible character).

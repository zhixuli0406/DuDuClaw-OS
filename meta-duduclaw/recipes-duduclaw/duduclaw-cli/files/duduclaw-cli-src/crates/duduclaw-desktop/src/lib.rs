//! Native desktop control for DuDuClaw L5b Computer Use.
//!
//! Provides cross-platform mouse, keyboard, and screenshot capabilities
//! using `enigo` (input simulation) and OS-native screen-capture tools
//! (see `capture.rs`).
//!
//! This crate powers the L5b (native) path, where the AI agent directly
//! controls the host machine's desktop — as opposed to L5a (container)
//! which uses Xvfb + xdotool inside a Docker container.
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! L5b is inherently higher risk than L5a. The caller is responsible for:
//! - Checking `CapabilitiesConfig.computer_use_mode == Native`
//! - Enforcing `CONTRACT.toml [must_not]` rules
//! - Running the `RiskDetector` before each action
//! - Providing channel-based confirmation for high-risk actions
//! - Implementing emergency stop (user activity detection via `rdev`)
